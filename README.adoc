= **Consetion Kiosk Demo**
====================
:imagesdir: img

== Prerequisites

Before you start, you’ll need access to a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. If you don’t already have access to one, you can install Red Hat CodeReady Containers, which will allow you to run OpenShift in the CodeReady Containers virtual machine on your local computer. To install CodeReady Containers, go to https://try.openshift.com and choose Laptop as your infrastructure provider:

Another option is to sign up for OpenShift Online’s free starter tier or a 30-day free trial of the pro tier.

Once you have access to an OpenShift cluster, be sure you have access to the odo command-line tool.

=== **Installing odo on Linux**

==== [aqua]**Binary installation**

```
# curl -L https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/odo/latest/odo-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/odo
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/odo
```

==== [aqua]**Tarball installation**
```
# sh -c 'curl -L https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/odo/latest/odo-linux-amd64.tar.gz | gzip -d > /usr/local/bin/odo'
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/odo
```

=== **Installing odo on macOS**

==== [aqua]**Binary installation**

```
# curl -L https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/odo/latest/odo-darwin-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/odo
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/odo
```

==== [aqua]**Tarball installation**
```
# sh -c 'curl -L https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/odo/latest/odo-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | gzip -d > /usr/local/bin/odo'
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/odo
```

== **Deploy the back end nodejs app on OpenShift**

.1. Create a folder to store backend and frontend code 
```
mkdir kiosk
cd kiosk
```
.2. you need to get the code from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/Keyvan-rh/kiosk-backend.git
cd kiosk-backend/
```

.3. Use odo to build and deploy backend to Openshift

```
odo login <ocp server API uri> -u <user> -p <password>
odo project create kiosk
odo create nodejs backend
odo push
```

[teal]#Output:#

image::odo-backend.png[500,500]

NOTE: Check the log and make sure the app started correctly

image::backend-log.png[500,500]

NOTE: If you login to Openshift 4.2 you should see your depoyment on the developers view:

image::ocp-dev-backend.png[500,500]

== **Deploy the front end nodejs app on OpenShift**

NOTE: Make sure you are in the folder you create on step one above [yellow]**kiosk** before movin forward.

.1. Get code from github
```
git clone https://github.com/Keyvan-rh/kiosk-frontend.git
cd kiosk-frontend/
```

.2. Use odo to build and deploy backend to Openshift

```
odo create nodejs frontend
odo push
```

[teal]#Output:#

image::odo-frontend.png[500,500]
================================
image::ocp-dev-frontend.png[500,500]

NOTE: validate that the frontend app is start with 

As the frontend app needs to be accessed by client outside of the openshift we need to create a **URL** for it, this is done with the following commands:
```
odo url create
odo push
```
get the **URL** you just created and access it on your browser. you should see this image:
```
odo url list
```
image::kiosk-menu.png[500,500]


.3. Link Frontend to Backend 
Now that we have both frontend and backend deployed we need to make sure that the frontend app would use the backend as a service to fulfill the request.
This is easliy easdone by the [green]*odo link* command as below:
```
cd <frontend folder location>
odo link backend
```
Lets test the application, go to the frontend app in your browser and order something.
you shouled see this responce:

image::order-no-db.png[500,250]

as you can see the order number is 9999 and you can not see your items this is because the backedn opp need a database to store the orders which we have not deployed yet. as long as we are in a role let do it!

.4. Create an ephemeral mongodb 

To create a mongodb we can use the following command :
```
odo service create
``` 
this command will show a list of available service provided by openshift out of the box. lets pick database and select mongodb-ephemeral
you can accept the rest of default values.

image::odo-service-1.png[500,250]
image::odo-service-2.png[500,250]

NOTE: if you do not want to step through this process just run the following command
```
odo service create mongodb-ephemeral mongodb-ephemeral --plan default -p DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=mongodb -p MEMORY_LIMIT=512Mi -p MONGODB_DATABASE=sampledb -p MONGODB_VERSION=3.6
```
image::ocp-dev-db.png[500,500]

We are almost done, now that we have a database we just need to link it top the backend appl.
if you accept the default values the name of your servcie for the mongodb should be mongodb-ephemeral and you can use the followin command to link them together.
```
cd <backend app code location>
odo link mongodb-ephemeral
```
you should see an output similar to this:

image::db-link.png[500,500]

after linking database to backend the odo is adding some extra environment variable to your pod and would restart the pod so the aplication could utilize trhe to connect to the database.

NOTE: you can explore this in index.js file in your backend folder:
const dbConnectionUrl = process.env.MONGODB_URL || 'mongodb://' + process.env.username +':'+ process.env.password+'@mongodb/' +process.env.database_name;

Lets try ordering again, this time you see your order recorder and get an order number.

image::order.png[500,500]

We are not completely done just stay with me for couple more minuts.
Lets say you build this app and demo it to your manager and they like everything but siad that some front end looks too cartoonee and want you to change that.
I have prepare anouther set that for the sake of time you can use and see what it would take to change the app and redeploy as this is a normal part of our life as a developer, code, deploy, validate, and start over.

Do the following to use the new set of images.
```
cd <frontend app code location>
mv public/images public/images-2
mv public/images-1 public/images
mv public/stylesheets/style.css public/stylesheets/style-2.css
mv public/stylesheets/style-1.css public/stylesheets/style.css
```
Now that we have change the assets lets redeploy the code:

```
odo push
```
Lets try ordering again, this time you see your order recorder and get an order number.

image::order-change-1.png[500,500]
image::order-change-2.png[500,500]

Now the boss is happy, but we know that is not through and they ask to change it again but know you know after the code change you just need to say/type the magic word [green]** odo push**
